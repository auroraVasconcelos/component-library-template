# Component library template
This template can be used to create a component library repository using stencilJS.

When you created your own repository with this template please follow the following instructions and change this readme according to your project setup afterwards.

#### 1. After installing the packages, use `npm run init` to initialize your project. You can customize the preview here: .storybook/customTheme.js
#### 2. Create new components with `npm run generate` - Don't forget to use a dash in the component's name! There is already an example component in the components folder to give you an idea.
#### 3. Start the build and serve process with `npm start`.
